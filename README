This file is a table of contents for my Queens Puzzle repository:

1) README - this file (a table of contents)

2) Makefile - tool created to enable easier compilation of Queens.c

3) Queens.c -  C program that uses recursion to find all solutions to the n-Queens problem
   Usage: Enter "Queens <n>" where 1 <= n <= 15 and you will see how many possible solutions
          there are for the specified board size. 
          Enter "Queens -v <n>" where 1 <= n <= 15 and you will see all possible permutations
          of solutions given the specified board size. You will also be given the total number
          of permutations provided.
